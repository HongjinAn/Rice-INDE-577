# Logistic Regression

## Introduction

Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. Multinomial logistic regression can model scenarios where there are more than two possible discrete outcomes. The best way to think about logistic regression is that it is a linear regression but for classification problems. 

## File

"Logistic Regression.ipynb" contains the description and code of Logistic Regression algorithm, then it's applied on *penguins* dataset loaded from *seaborn*.

## Dataset

"Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin dataset" from seaborn has 344 entries, 0 to 343, 7 columns: 
species:penguin species (Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo)
culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
body_mass_g: body mass (g)
island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
sex: penguin sex
