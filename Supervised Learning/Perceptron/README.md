# Perceptron
 
In Machine Learning, Perceptron is the primary step to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning technologies, which consists of a set of weights, input values or scores, and a threshold. Perceptron is a building block of an Artificial Neural Network. Initially, in the mid of 19th century, Mr. Frank Rosenblatt invented the Perceptron for performing certain calculations to detect input data capabilities or business intelligence. Perceptron is a linear Machine Learning algorithm used for supervised learning for various binary classifiers.

## Task
In this project, I will build a perceptron model from scratch and implement the perceptron learning algorithm for binary species classification.

## Dataset
The *breast cancer wisconsin* dataset is loaded from *sklearn.datasets*. The *breast cancer* dataset is a classic and very easy binary classification dataset. It has 2 classes of target labels, each label has samples of 212,357, and the total sample size is 569. It has 30 numeric, predictive attributes, such as radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter), texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values),perimeter, area, smoothness (local variation in radius lengths),compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0),etc.
