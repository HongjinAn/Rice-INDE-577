# Rice-INDE-577 Data Science and Machine Learning

This repository is created by Hongjin An, a graduate student of Professional Master's in Statistics at Rice University. In this repository, I provide various scripts and jupyter notebooks illustrating data science and machine learning in INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning course which instrcudted by Dr. Randy Davila, during the Spring 2023 semester at the Rice University. This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. Textbooks are Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron; Machine Learning with Python for Everyone, Addison Wesley Data & Analytics Series, 2020 Pearson Education, by Mark E. Fenner.

This curse provides me the concepts, tools, and intuition that I needed to implement programs capable of learning from data. It covers a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression, to some of the Deep Learning techniques. 

## Description

For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name and contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in INDE 577, a README file, and dataset used or images (if applicable).


## Supervised Learning

* Perceptron
* Linear Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Network
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision & Regression Trees
* Ensemble Learning

## Unsupervised Learning

* K-Means Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis(PCA)


## Data

All the data used in these algorithms are from public database, such as Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/], Scikit-learn datasets[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets], etc. And some random data are generated as needed in the code.

## Programming Tools and Libraries

Python,Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.
