# Rice-INDE-577 Data Science and Machine Learning

This repository is created by Hongjin An, a student of Professional Master's in Statistics at Rice University. In this repository, I provide various scripts and jupyter notebooks illustrating data science and machine learning in INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning course which instrcudted by Dr. Randy Davila, during the Spring 2022 semester at the Rice University. This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. We are recommended use the textbook :Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron.

This curse provides me the concepts, tools, and intuition that I needed to implement programs capable of learning from data. It covers a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression, to some of the Deep Learning techniques. The below content section shows the most but not limited to the topics I have learned in the class.

# Content

## Supervised Learning
1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. Gradient Descent
3. Linear Regression
4. Logistic Regression
5. Perceptron
6. Multi Layer Perceptron
7. Decision Trees
8. Random Forests
9. Ensemble Learning

## Unsupervised Learning
1. K-Means Clustering

# Data
All the data used in these algorithms are from public database, such as Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/], Scikit-learn datasets[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets], etc. And some random numberical data are generated as needed in the code.

# Programming Tools and Libraries
Python,Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.
