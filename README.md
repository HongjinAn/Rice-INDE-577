# Data Science and Machine Learning

This repository is created by Hongjin An, a graduate student of Professional Master's in Statistics at Rice University. This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. Textbooks are Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron; Machine Learning with Python for Everyone, Addison Wesley Data & Analytics Series, 2020 Pearson Education, by Mark E. Fenner.

This course provides me the concepts, tools, and intuition that I needed to implement programs capable of learning from data. It covers a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression, to some of the Deep Learning techniques. 

## Description

For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name and contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in INDE 577, a README file, and dataset used or images (if applicable).


## Supervised Learning

* Perceptron
* Linear Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Network
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision & Regression Trees
* Ensemble Learning

## Unsupervised Learning

* K-Means Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis(PCA)


## Data

All the data used in these algorithms are from public database, such as Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/], Scikit-learn datasets[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets], etc. And some random data are generated as needed in the code.

## Programming Tools and Libraries

Python,Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.
