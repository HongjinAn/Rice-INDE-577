# Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction
Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, which is an important mode of learning in people, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world and then generate imaginative content from it. In contrast to supervised learning where data is tagged by an expert, e.g. as a "ball" or "fish", unsupervised methods exhibit self-organization that captures patterns as probability densities or a combination of neural feature preferences. The other levels in the supervision spectrum are reinforcement learning where the machine is given only a numerical performance score as guidance, and semi-supervised learning where a smaller portion of the data is tagged.Unsupervised learning models are utilized for three main tasks—clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction.

## Unsupervised vs. Supervised Learning
Unlike unsupervised learning algorithms, supervised learning algorithms use labeled data. From that data, it either predicts future outcomes or assigns data to specific categories based on the regression or classification problem that it is trying to solve. While supervised learning algorithms tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. However, these labelled datasets allow supervised learning algorithms to avoid computational complexity as they don’t need a large training set to produce intended outcomes. Common regression and classification techniques are linear and logistic regression, naïve bayes, KNN algorithm, and random forest.

## Challenge
While unsupervised learning has many benefits, some challenges can occur when it allows machine learning models to execute without any human intervention. Some of these challenges can include:

* Computational complexity due to a high volume of training data
* Longer training times
* Higher risk of inaccurate results
* Human intervention to validate output variables
* Lack of transparency into the basis on which data was clustered
